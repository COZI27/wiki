* The Assembly downloader will download the 2016 main branch. It does not work for Halo Reach PC. Make sure to click the 2019 "dev_" branch.

* Importing sounds from other maps is disabled as that feature is not yet complete. A time consuming method to adding sounds does exist. Importing vehicles such as the falcon will not come with its sound files.
See Map to Map sound injection for more information:

* Editing collision boxes is not possible. Models need to be imported with their collision information and that feature is not currently available.
